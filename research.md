<h1>Earth's continents–their orgin and evolution</h1>

---

Earth is unique in many ways. It's the only planet in the solar system that has continents--the high standing crust that has a felsic bulk composition (rich in Si, low in Mg and Fe). When and how did the continental crust form on Earth? As a land species, we want to know the answers because we owe our existence to Earth continents. The growth and evolution of the continental crust are closely related to many geological and surface processes, including the evolution of life. Studying Earth’s continental crust also provides clues to understanding the evolution of other terrestrial planets. And ultimately, this may help us to find out the habitability on exoplanets because of the intrinsic relationships between the evolution of the crust and the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.

Earth's continents have been restless since their formation. They have been "drifting" around over Earth history. Sometimes they assemble to form supercontinents; sometimes they break up into several pieces, like modern continents. The continents are separated by oceans and oceanic crust lying beneath, which is generated at mid-ocean ridges and subducted near continental margins. The movement of continents is accompanied by the open of new oceans and close of the old. This process is called "plate tectonics", the major engine that drives the mass exchange between Earth interior and surface. Plate tectonics, which makes Earth an active planet today, has never been observed on other terrestrial planets.

Continents and plate tectonics, both unique to our planet, are actually linked to each other.

In our latest work, we found new evidence for when the present-day like continents started to form. About 3 billion years ago, the proto-continent, with the subaerial area only a fraction of modern continent, has a mafic bulk composition (rich in Mg and Fe, low in Si), comparable to the surface of other terrestrial planets in the solar system, like Venus and Mars. The mafic subaerial crust gradually transformed to a felsic and present-day like crust from 3 to 2.5 billion years ago, attended by a massive subaerial area expansion. Driving this fundamental transition is probably the initiation of global plate tectonics within this time window, which transported water, a key component to generate felsic magma, to the sources.

**Fig. 1**. A size-composition comparison between the proto-continents in the early Archean (>3 billion years ago) and present-day continents. The distribution and shapes of the early Archean proto-continents shown here are not real. The green color of the early Archean ocean indicates high Fe (II) contents in the seawater at that time. Fe (II) is an ion that makes a green solution.
