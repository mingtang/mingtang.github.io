On 4/22/2017, the Earth day, hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world walked onto the streets to march for science, and protest against the Trump administration that failed to appreciate science. These photos were taken in Houston, TX. It was a lot fun to be part of this march event and walk with the smartest people in the world.
