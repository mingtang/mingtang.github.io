In this past summer, I joined a field trip in southern Tibet, one of my not-so-many long serious field trips. The field trip was led by Dr. Weiqiang Ji from CAS. We had a total of eight people on our team, including six geologists and two local drivers. It was my first time to be in Tibet. 7/6-7/22.

Tibet is special to geologists, nature enthusiasts, or everyone perhaps. It is the largest mountain belt/plateau in the world. Tibet is home to numerous high mountains, including Mt. Everest, the highest peak in the world. It is the roof of the planet. Tibet is unique its landscapes, climate, ecosystems, people and culture. Tibet is high and lonely. It is far less accessible than other mountainous areas, and remains as one of the least known places to the world. Tibet is an extreme land.

Tibet started to rise somewhat 50-70 million years ago, and is still rising today. The rise of Tibet is due much to the collision between India and Asia. Tibet is a facinating place to study geology. It's a complicated dynamic system and just about everyone in Earth sciences can find something to his/her taste in Tibet. We landed in Lhasa on 7/6, took a break on 7/7 and started off our journey on 7/8. The altitude effect was always there, but I got used to it after a couple of days. My fitbit Alta HR recorded a gradual increase of my resting heart rate from < 60 to 75 in the first week. I knew my body was adapting to the low oxygen.

Farms of highland barley (青稞). Rice and wheat do not grow well in Tibet due to the lack of water. Highland barley instead is the staple food here.

In the remote areas, many villages have only a dozen of households.

The rain is coming. Summer is the wet season in Tibet, and we had quite a lot of raining days during the trip.

Weiqiang was giving some introductions about the local geology at this outcrop of Dazhuka conglomerate. It was near the end of that day.

Emerald Lake is such a pretty isolated place hidden in the heart of Yoho National Park. Across the bridge you enter the Emerald Lake Lodge. No private cars are allowed in the lodge area. They have a small bus to transport guests between the lodge and the lodge parking lot, which is about a km away. There was no cell phone reception, no WiFi, no TVs in the room, no connection with the outside whatsoever. Calm down and enjoy nature. We stayed in the Emerald Lake Lodge for two days.

Field, a small town inside Yoho, between Lake Louise and Emerald Lake. We found here when looking for restaurants on google maps. Field has less than 200 residents. Field is known for the Burgess Shale. CPR train track workers in Field discovered the fossils in the Burgess Shale back in the early 1900s. Burgess Shale later led to great scientific discoveries about early life on Earth. More information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale). Unfortunately, the visitor center in Field was closed when we were there.

Mountains surrounding Lake Louise. I took this shot after decending from a hill by the lake. Quite a venture since the decending trail we took was not maintained and was heavily covered by snow. Very slippery and we saw nobody during our decent. There was also a avalanche warning at the trailhead. Anyway, we made it, with snowshoes.

After Lake Louise, we started our Icefields Parkway journey towards Jasper. Once we were on Icefields Parkway, cell phone reception died. There are no gas stations, rest areas, nothing for the next 232 km until one reaches Jasper. In the winter, the highway can be partially or completely covered by snow and ice. So need to be very careful. All that said, it is very scenic and rewarding.

A huge crow standing in the snow. Our car got stuck in the snow when we tried to pull out from the shoulder...We were a bit scared, but thankfully, two backcountry skiers stopped by. They first shaveled the snow and ice beneath our front wheels, and then put snowshoes beneath them to give the car a bit more friction. Then they pushed the car out. Xin gave them a box of maple cookies to thank them.

Snowshoeing to see the Athabasca Glacier. We didn't see it because the visibility was so low that day. Everything was white and bright. And it was snowing all the time. But snowshoeing in such a wild place was fun. It was just the snow, mountains, Xin and me.
